Pixabay Terms of Service

Last updated: May 9, 2024

    1.The basics.

    Welcome to Pixabay! Pixabay is a vibrant community of creatives sharing royalty-free content. These Terms of Service ("Terms") apply to the pixabay.com website, related websites, software, mobile apps, plug-ins and other Pixabay-operated services (collectively, the "Service(s)").

    These Terms govern the relationship between Pixabay, a Canva Germany GmbH brand ("we", "our" or "Pixabay") and any user of the Service ("you", "your" or "User"), including in certain circumstances, the relationship between Users. By using the Service (including by downloading and using Content from the Service, or contributing Content or Communications to the Service):
        you agree that you are entering into these Terms with us which will become a legally binding agreement between you and us; and
        you represent and warrant that you have the full right, power and authority to agree to and be bound by these Terms and to fully perform all of your obligations listed in these Terms.

    If you don’t agree to these Terms, please don’t use the Service.

    Children may not access or use the Service unless their use is directly authorized by their parent, guardian or another authorized adult who agrees to be bound by these Terms. For the purposes of these Terms, a child is a person under the age of 13 (or the minimum legal age required to provide consent for processing of personal data in the country where the child is located, noting 16 is the minimum legal age in Germany).

    We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify these Terms at any time, including the right to cancel or change the licenses granted by these Terms. If we do this, we will post the most current version of these Terms on this page. We will seek to provide you with reasonable notice of any change to the Terms that, in our sole determination, materially adversely affect your rights or your use of the Service. We may provide you with this notice via the Service and/or by direct message on the Service and/or by posting on Pixabay’s public forum. By continuing to use the Service after any revised Terms become effective, you agree to be bound by the new Terms.
    2.Content.

    In these Terms when we refer to "Content" we are referring to the content which is available on the Service, but excluding any third party paid advertising or sponsored content (over which Pixabay has no control and we do not grant any license). Content includes, but isn’t limited to the following items:
        "Images", which means photographs, vector graphics, drawings and illustrations.
        "Videos", which means moving images, animations, film footage and other audio-visual representations and content.
        "Audio", which means music, sounds, sound effects and other audio representations and content.
        "Other Media", which means any other media or content which is visual or audio in nature, or a combination of these,

    and includes in each case any associated text, captions, descriptions or metadata.
    3.Communications.

    Pixabay also makes available various functionality across the Service which allows you to interact and communicate with the Service and with other Users, for example by:
        selecting a username, uploading a profile photo and creating a profile page;
        making contributions in our Pixabay forum and discussion rooms;
        leaving comments on any Content or blog articles;
        sending messages to other users via our messaging functionality; and/or
        any other communications submitted by you through the Service, together, “Communication(s)”.
    4.CC0 License

    Some of the Content made available for download on the Service is subject to and licensed under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license ("CC0 Content"). CC0 Content on the Service is any content which lists a "Published date" prior to January 9, 2019. This means that to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law, the authors of that work have dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the CC0 Content worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights. Subject to the CC0 License Terms, the CC0 Content can be used for all personal and commercial purposes without attributing the author/ content owner of the CC0 Content or Pixabay.
    5.Content License granted to you for Content (other than CC0 Content).

    Subject to the Prohibited Uses described below (which you agree and acknowledge you are not entitled to engage in), when you download any Content that is not CC0 Content from the Service, we grant you an irrevocable, worldwide, perpetual (or as long as allowed by law), non-exclusive and royalty-free right to download, use, copy, modify or adapt the Content for commercial or non-commercial purposes ('Content License'). The rights granted are non-exclusive, meaning that we may also grant other users the same rights in the same Content. For the avoidance of doubt, you do not obtain any rights in any other users’ Communications.

    You agree and acknowledge that the following items are "Prohibited Uses" and the Content License which we grant to you is conditional on you not engaging in any of the Prohibited Uses.

        You cannot sell or distribute the Content (either in digital or physical form) on a Standalone basis. This includes selling or distributing Content on a Standalone basis as an image, audio, video, NFT or other digital file (including through a stock media platform), as well as a print, wallpaper, poster or on merchandise or on other physical products.

        When we refer to "Standalone" we mean where no creative effort has been applied to the Content and it remains in substantially the same form as it exists on the Service. To help illustrate this, here are some examples:
            using the Content in its original form or solely using a filter, changing colors, resizing or cropping the Content remains Standalone use.
            using the Content with a combination of images, videos, audio files, other media, text, illustrations, background features and editing techniques is not Standalone use, so long as the combined effect is to make a "new" creative work.
        If Content depicts any trademarks, logos or brands (whether two- or three-dimensional), you cannot use that Content for commercial purposes in relation to goods and services, in particular not print that Content on merchandise or other physical products for sale.
        You cannot use Content in any immoral or illegal way, especially Content which features a recognisable person. You cannot use any Content on or in conjunction with anything pornographic, obscene, offensive (including but not limited to in relation to adult entertainment venues, escort services, drug use, dating services, in a way which portrays someone as suffering from, or medicating for, a physical or mental ailment), illegal, immoral, infringing, defamatory, hateful, threatening or libellous in nature, in a political context (such as the promotion, advertisement or endorsement of any party, candidate, or elected official or in connection with any political party or viewpoint) or in breach of any law, regulation or industry code, or in any way which infringes the rights of any person or entity.
        You cannot use Content in a misleading or deceptive way. You cannot use Content in a way that is misleading or deceptive, including without limit:
            by suggesting that any depicted person, brand, organization or other third party endorses or is affiliated with you or your goods or services, unless permission has been granted; or
            by giving the impression that Content was created by you, or a person other than the intellectual property rights holder of the Content (including without limitation, by claiming or giving the impression that you hold ownership of, or exclusive rights to, the Content).
        You cannot use any of the Content as part of a trade-mark, design-mark, trade-name, business name or service mark.

    In addition to the Prohibited Uses, please be aware that certain Content (including CC0 Content) may be subject to additional intellectual property rights (such as copyrights, trademarks, design rights), moral rights, proprietary rights, property rights, privacy rights or similar. This includes but is not limited to identifiable people, logos, brands of all kinds (whether two- or three- dimensional), goods or services, buildings and architecture, audio or video samples and organisations.

    Before using any Content (including CC0 Content), you must consider whether you require the consent of a third party or a license to use the Content. If your use of the Content is for commercial purposes (e.g. in conjunction with the sale or promotion of a product or service) then it is likely that you will need consent or a license. Responsibility for determining whether permissions are needed always rests solely and exclusively with you. We do not warrant that any consents or licenses have been obtained in relation to any Content, and we expressly disclaim any and all responsibility and liability in relation to such matters.
    6.Attribution.

    You do not need to credit Pixabay or the contributor of Content when you use it, but it is certainly appreciated when you do so - especially when the use is of an editorial nature, where photo credits are more customary. You can provide credit in the following format: "by [Contributor] via Pixabay".
    7A.Uploading Content or Communications.

    We are always grateful when you choose to contribute Content or Communications to our Service. For us to be able to make the Content and Communications available for other users, it is important that we receive specific rights and promises from you as a contributor. You are responsible for the Content and Communications you upload to the Service and you do so subject to the following terms and conditions:
        When you upload any Content to the Service you grant Pixabay an irrevocable, perpetual (or as long as allowed by law), worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sub-license) to use, store, market, reproduce, display, exhibit, broadcast, publicly perform, enhance, alter, adapt, modify or download the Content (in whole or in part) for any purpose whether now known or created in the future, including both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

If you don’t want your Content to be used for machine learning, you can manage how we use your Content by opting out of future AI training by updating your preferences in your account settings at any time.

This applies whether the claim is threatened, potential or actual.

Any non-English translations of these Terms are provided for convenience only. The English version of these Terms will control.

    If one or more of the provisions in this agreement is found to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions should not be affected. Such provisions should be revised only to the extent necessary to make them enforceable.
    16.Prize Draws and Promotions.

    From time to time, Pixabay may conduct prize draws, contests or promotions (“Promotion”), which will be governed by separate additional terms and conditions, which will be published on the Service or otherwise notified to you by Pixabay.
