Villagers
- start with villagers at area center
- pathfinding, takes slopes into account
- vills can do things, this has costs & they have desired for these thing
  - decisions based on desire, cost & random; some tasks have prerequisites
  - walk somewhere
    - desire lines -> lower path cost; generate paths
  - gather resources
    - food & water (consumed), wood & stone (for building)
    - creating a field/quarry costs more than using it
    - field has limited capacity, trees need to be cut for wood, quarry expands on use
  - build something
    - requires resources
      - adjust building style based on availability
    - stairs, bridges greatly lower path cost 
    - house
    - well/pen/field/quarry, public buildings like church
      - cost shared between thoose agents who use it
    - beautification (trees on wayside, scarecrows, ...)
  - live
    - sleep at night
    - later: eat, converse, ...
- record everything, replay it ingame
  - structure build block-by-block
    - command block repeater chains for performant block-by-block
      - load chunks via world spawn or portal loaders?
  - after everything's finished, randomly replay trips
- in-game trades based on resources?
- jobs?

Buildings
- material variations based on used materials (e.g. oak log, birch planks, granite)
- wooden doors placed so that the closed state appears open 
  -> villagers & zombies can't interact with them
- lots of fun todo

Error handling
- one-shot tool -> just exit on error


Flatten world data (no chunks)?
- single array each for blocks, biomes, heightmap, watermap...

Areas:
- polygon
- corners/edges shared between areas
- Ramer-Douglas-Peucker
  - small number of points for buildings, medium/high for farms, roads


Move stuff to gpu?
- very quick, can do some otherwise very heavy passes
- not neccessary for majority of work (10min CPU time allowed, multithreading allowed)
- quite some effort (although some things are embarrassingly parallel)
Instead: multithreading
- easy for e.g. Chunk loading

Be wary of lava
- don't build anything flamable nearby
- prevent lava flows
