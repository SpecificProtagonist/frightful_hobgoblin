Flatten world data (no chunks)
- single array each for blocks, biomes, heightmap, watermap...

Areas:
- polygon
- corners/edges shared between areas
- Ramer-Douglas-Peucker
  - small number of points for buildings, medium/high for farms, roads


Move stuff to gpu?
- can do some otherwise very heavy passes
- not neccessary for majority of work (10min CPU time allowed, multithreading allowed)

Be wary of lava
- don't build anything flamable nearby
- prevent lava flows
